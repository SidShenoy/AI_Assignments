# Chatbot
->  This chatbot is called "Amey" (after my lazy colleague). He is capable of answering all kinds of basic questions.  
->  He can search through the internet for questions starting with "Who, when, where, how".  
->  For questions starting with "What",he assumes that the question is about the current temperature in a city whose name is the last word in the question.  
  e.g. "What is the temperature in Hyderabad?" will give you the current temperature in Hyderabad.  
  e.g. "What Hyderabad?" will also give you the current temperature in Hyderabad.  
->  When the user types "exit", the chat window closes and a log file for the current conversation is automatically created in the "amey/logs" folder.  

### GUI

1.  This is the first window that appears and prompts the user to enter a username.

2.  After the user enters the username, the chat window opens and the user is greeted with a welcome message.
